### Quality Reporting
- Detailed Markdown report with:
  - Dataset overview and quality metrics
  - Issue classification and counts
  - Correction explanations
  - Statistical analysis
  - Data quality score (0-100)
  - Actionable recommendations

### Automation
- GitHub Actions workflow that:
  - Triggers on dataset changes
  - Runs validation automatically
  - Commits updated reports
